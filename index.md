## Resource List

1. [Simon Quinn - Debating in the World Schools Style](http://sanujarajasinghe.com/debating/PRINTE%20-%20World%20Schools%20Debating%20-%20A%20Guide%20by%20Simon%20Quinn.pdf) - This is the main book we use for school sessions, as well as all the major tournaments. This is divided into three sections: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. We urge all members to at least read the Beginner sections of the book. Additional resources by the author can also be found [here](http://www.learndebating.com/).
2. [Debating Handbook](https://sanujarajasinghe.com/debating/Debating%20Handbook%20(OCRd).pdf) - This was a handout a coach gave some time ago. It contains basic information about the WSDC style, as well as principled arguments. Useful if you're in a hurry, or need a quick briefing. Please go through this as well if you're a more experienced debater.
3. [University of Vermont - Debate Central](http://debate.uvm.edu/) - This site has many useful resources for debating, including countless lectures and debates. If you're lucky, you may find a recorded debate of your topic over here. The videos have also been (partially) archived at [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/AlfredSniderVimeoVideo).
4. [Monash Association of Debaters - Training Handbooks](https://monashdebaters.com/training-resources/training-handbooks/) - Once you have progressed past basic debating, you may find this collection of books to be useful, as they contain a lot of advanced debating techniques and theory that might give you a competitive edge.
5. [Michael J. Sandel - Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?](https://www.amazon.com/Justice-Whats-Right-Thing-Do-ebook/dp/B002RUA4XE/) - This book will help you gain some added knowledge in principled debating, while having an interesting narrative style to it. Also available in [video form](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30C13C91CFFEFEA6).

We may add more resources later on, so make sure to check back here.
